A simple script to exract all kinds of health and capabilities information about your Grafana deployment. Send the output to your fave AI toolkit and ask it to analyze it. Ask it "what is right, what is wrong and what is missing". Believe you me, it may come back with advice that you couldn't even imagine! I personally use Claude Sonnet 4.5, but others like GPT-5 can also give you hints about what to fix and also how to fix it.
